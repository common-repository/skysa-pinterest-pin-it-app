Let people share (pin) images from any page of your site on Pinterest

== Description ==

Pinterest is one of the hottest places for sharing images. The Skysa Pinterest Pin It App allows your site visitors to easily pin images from any page of your site by adding a customizable Pinterest Pin It button at the bottom of your site.

The Pin It button is customizable allowing you to choose the Pin It button icon (this defaults to a simple Pinterest logo) and change the Pin It text.

Images pinned from your website on Pinterest automatically link back to your site from Pinterest increasing your site traffic.
